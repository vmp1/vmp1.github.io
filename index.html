<strong> Welcome to my webpage!</strong>

<p> </p>

<p>I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Economic Growth Center at Yale University. 
  My research interests are development economics and the economics of education. 
  Currently, I am focusing on two particular areas: 1) the analysis of income inequality and poverty dynamics with an emphasis on developing economies and 
 (2) how test-based accountability policies affect school closures in the U.S. 
  I use advanced econometric methods and microsimulations in my research.</p>
  
 <p>I hold a Ph.D. from the Economics Department at Tulane University and B.Sc./M.A. in Economics from Universidad de Los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.</p>
