<strong> Welcome to my webpage!</strong>

<p> </p>

<p>I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Economic Growth Center at Yale University. 
  I am an applied economist working on development economics with a particular interest in the economics of education, inequality, and poverty. 
  Currently, I am focusing on two research lines: 1) the analysis of inequality and poverty dynamics in developing countries and 
  2) the study of school closures in the US. 
  I use advanced econometric methods and microsimulations in my research.</p>
  
<p>I hold a Ph.D. from the Economics Department at Tulane University and B.Sc./M.A. in Economics from Universidad de Los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia.</p>

<p>I am on the 2022-2023 job market and I will be available for online interviews during the ASSA 2023 annual meeting.<p>
