<strong> Welcome to my webpage!</strong>

<p> </p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Tulane University. I graduated from Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia with B.Sc./M.A. in Economics. </p>

<p>My research interests include economics of education, inequality, and poverty. 
  Currently, I focus on two research branches. First, I study the patterns of school closures in America and how accountability policies affect them. 
  Second, I study income inequality and poverty with an emphasis on developing economies.
  I use advanced econometrics methods and microsimulations in my research.</p>
