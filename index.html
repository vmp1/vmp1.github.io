<strong> Welcome to my webpage!</strong>

<p> </p>

<p>I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Tulane University. I am a graduate in Economics (B.Sc./M.A.) from Universidad de Los Andes in Bogot√°, Colombia. </p>

<p>My research interests are economics of education, inequality, and poverty. 
  Currently, I am focusing on two particular areas: 1) how test-based accountability policies affect school closures in America; 
  and 2) analysis income inequality and poverty dynamics with an emphasis on developing economies.
  I use advanced econometric methods and microsimulations in my research.</p>
