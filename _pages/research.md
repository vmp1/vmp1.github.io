*Was Implementation Left Behind? A National Analysis of State and Federal School Accountability* Job Market Paper.

No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and the state accountability systems implemented during the 1990s have included an increasingly intense series of interventions for low-performing schools. If the initial steps were insufficient, schools were supposed to be closed, taken over by other education organizations, or reconstituted. Using an event study analysis, I find that state accountability and NCLB itself had a null effect on the frequency of closure and takeover of publicly funded schools in the country. My findings suggest that the infrequent and weak implementation of the most extreme sanctions on low-performing schools is partly behind the limited effect of accountability policies on student performance. Likewise, the lack of alignment behind the closure decisions could partially explain the mixed results of the impact of closures on student performance.
